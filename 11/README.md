=== Transcription Results ===
Summary:
The patient presents with sharp chest pain lasting a few seconds, starting three days ago, located over the heart and sometimes radiating to the neck. The pain worsens with coughing or lying down and improves when leaning forward. The patient rates the pain as 6/10 and has no other symptoms like shortness of breath or palpitations. They recently recovered from the flu and have no significant past medical history or medications except occasional Tylenol. The patient's father recently died of a heart attack, raising concern. The patient is a healthy 25-year-old engineering student working part-time as a postman, with occasional alcohol use and no smoking or drug use. The healthcare provider plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to investigate further and reassures the patient to avoid excessive worry until results are available.
